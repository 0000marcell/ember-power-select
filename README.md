# Ember-power-select

I was tired of reinventing select components because other options were not easy to customized,
so I decided to built one.

Based in select2.js, but built from scratch, 100% in ember.

**Disclaimer**: This component is in its first days of life. Although I don't expect the public API
to suffer significant changes be aware creating your own component that extends from this is not adviced
yet.
