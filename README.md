# Ember-Power-Select

Ember Power Select is an Ember-first select component modeled after [Select2](https://select2.github.io/).

**Disclaimer**: This component is in a very early alpha stage. Although the public API is not expected
to suffer significant changes, be aware that creating your own component that extends from this is not advised
yet.
