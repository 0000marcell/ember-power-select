<h1 class="doc-page-title">Navigable select</h1>

<p>
  Ember Power Select's design decision of being build by composing several independent components
  makes it perfect for build your own custom components by replacing parts of with with your own components.
</p>

<p>
  Usually this feature will be used for customize the appearance appearance, but it can also be
  use to build completely different behaviors.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how to build a component that show grouped options as a navigable menu
  a multi-level select with animations with just a few lines of code.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see the result:
</p>

{{#code-example hbs="navigable-select-1.hbs" js="navigable-select-1-js.js" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-example}}

<p>
  Nice? Probably it will require less code than you think.
</p>

<p>
  Before writing any code lets install <code>liquid-fire</code> for the animations.
</p>

<p>
  Now let's analyze the problem.
  The task consists basically in create a grouped select like this:
</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 250px;">
  {{#power-select
    options=groupedNumbers
    selected=selectedNumber
    onchange=(action (mut selectedNumber))
    as |option|
  }}
    {{option}}
  {{/power-select}}
</div>
<br>
<p>
  But in the new one the groups are regular options that can be highlighted, searched and interacted, and for
  backwards compatibility reasons should take the same arguments so it behaves like a drop-in replacement.
</p>

<p>
  The first evident difference is that the list of options is completely different. It uses liquid-fire for animations
  so we need to use the `optionsComponent` option to let Ember Power Select know that it should render our own custom
  component in the dropdown instead of the default one.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Another key difference is that the dropdown should not be closed when we select a group, only when we
    select a leaf node. We can do that with by passing `closeOnSelect=false`. That will keep the select open
    after selecting an option it will be up to use to decide when to close it, using the second argument
    received by the <code>onchange</code> option.
  </li>

  <li>
    Now let's consider filtering. Just for refreshment, keep in ming that Ember Power Selects considers any option with a <code>groupName</code>
    and <code>options</code> attributes to be a group itself, and the default search strategy will ignore it,
    so seems that this component will need to provide a custom search function function to the underlying select.
  </li>

  <li>
    The keyboard arrows also are a problem. By default only leaf options can be highlighted. This along
    with the search issues commented above makes us think that we should not treat groups as groups at all,
    so we should internally transform the groups into another data structure that doesn't look as a group
    for ember-power-select and in which each level keeps a reference to the parent level in order to
    navigate back to it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Ok, seems that all it's clear. Is time to code.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>navigable-select.hbs</code> template renders the select, and the yielded options will be
  leaf options or groups with more options inside. For avoiding confusion we'll call this transformed
  groups "levels".
</p>

{{code-snippet name="navigable-select-2.hbs"}}

<p>
  In the block we need to distinguish between 3 possible situations. The yielded object can be
  either a leaf option, a level, or the special object representing the parent level.
</p>

<p>
  We need to transform the grouped options into this new structure, recursively. A computed property
  seems perfect because it will update if the options change.
</p>

{{code-snippet name="navigable-select-2-js.js"}}

<p>
  This tail-recursive solution is not straightforward, but in exchange it supports any depth level.
  Just trust me on this one, the rest of the code is <em>much</em> simpler.
</p>

<p>
  Just below we create oneWay alias to this result. This is the collection of options that we're going
  to pass to Ember Power Select, and we will replace it with a different set of options when the
  user navigates to another level.
</p>

<p>
  The default list doesn't work for us, we need to create that "animated-options".
</p>

{{code-example hbs="navigable-select-3.hbs" js="navigable-select-3-js.js" showResult=false}}

<p>
  The template uses liquid-fire's <code>liquid-bind</code> component to animate when we swap the list
  of options, and we use the new <code>didReceiveAttrs</code> to detect if we're navigating to a
  lower level, upper level or we are just filtering, and decide the kind of animation.
</p>

<p>
  The last step is to handle handle the select action and swap the options when the selected item
  isn't a leaf node and provide custom search that we like:
</p>

{{code-snippet name="navigable-select-4-js.js"}}
