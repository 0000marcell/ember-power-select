<h1 class="doc-page-title">Create custom options</h1>

<p>
  Ember Power Select exposes an <code>onkeydown</code> action that allows you to
  react to keyboard events before the default behaviour takes place. This gives
  you the ability to enrich the component with very few lines of code.
</p>

<p>
  Let's create one component on top of the multiple select that, besides of allowing
  you to select among the selected options, lets you create new options on the fly.
</p>

<p>You guessed right, the typical tag creator.</p>

<p>
  Just define an action called <code>onkeydown</code>. That action will check if
  the pressed key is the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, it was pressed while the component
  is opened and there is no option highlighted and the used typed some text.
</p>

<p>
  If those 4 conditions are met, create a new item, add it to the list of options
  and use the <code>choose</code> action of the select (received as first argument)
  to select a new set of results.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Et voil√†</i>, you've created a component that allows you to create custom tags.
