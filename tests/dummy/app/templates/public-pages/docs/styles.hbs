<h1 class="doc-page-title">Styles</h1>

<p>
  This component <strong>does not</strong> provide any option to customize its visual
  appearance.
</p>

<p>
  You can do it using just plain old CSS. There is no rocket science on it, just override the default
  styles with your owns.
</p>

<p>
  However if you are a Sass user there is a more advanced method you can use
  to customize the styles without overriding them.
</p>

<p>
  Ember Power Select exposes 28 SASS variables you can set before importing
  the styles. By example:
</p>

<pre>
  // In your app.scss
  $ember-power-select-border-color: #64A5ED;
  $ember-power-select-border-radius: 0;

  @import 'ember-power-select';
</pre>

<p>
  Will make your selects to have pale blue borders with no rounded corners.
</p>

<p>
  This approach is powerful enough to build entire themes on top of it and to prove it Ember Power Select
  ships with a <a href="{{href-to 'public-pages.cookbook.bootstrap-theme'}}">Bootstrap theme</a> out of the box that
  can also be used in projects not using SASS.
</p>

<p>
  You can find the entire list of available variables in
  <a href="https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-select/blob/master/app/styles/ember-power-select/variables.scss">the source code</a>.
