<p>
  So far we've seen that Ember Power Select can take a fair amount of configuration options on
  invocations to alter its default behavior.
</p>

<p>
  But what happens when you want all your selects to behave on a certain way that is not the default one?
  Repeating the same options over and over on your templates is not pleasant and error prone.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to apply a configuration option to all your selects there is no special way
  or key in the <code>/config/environment.js</code> you need to learn.
  Just use The Ember Wayâ„¢.
</p>

<p>
  Inside your app's <code>/app/components</code> folder create a <code>ember-power-select.js</code>
  file:
</p>

<pre>
  import EmberPowerSelect from 'ember-power-select/components/power-select';

  export default EmberPowerSelect.extend({
    // Place here your system-wide preferences
    searchEnabled: false,
    allowClear: true,

    // You can even use computed properties to do other stuff, like apply i18n, that wouldn't be
    // possible with static configuration.
    i18n: Ember.inject.service(),
    loadingMessage: Ember.computed('i18n.locale', function() {
      return this.get('i18n').t('selects.loading');
    })
  });
</pre>

<p>
  That's all. No new concepts to learn, just your usual ember-cli work flow.
</p>

<p>
  In this example the component is also named <code>\{{ember-power-select}}</code> but using this approach
  you can create many components with different names that extend and customize Ember Power Select
  in different ways. Pick and choose.
