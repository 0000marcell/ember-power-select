<h1 class="doc-page-title">Why plugins</h1>

<p>
  To keep focus.
</p>

<p>
  Is just not possible to cover all possible different select-like components and
  still provide a minimal and easy to use API. Everybody wants an special tweak, a pinch of
  awesomeness here and there.
</p>

<p>
  And yet, nobody likes massive components whose bloated APIs needs a 8 pages manual describing
  all the possible options.
</p>

<p>
  The goal of Ember Power Select is to be easy to use and customize, so it enables community members
  to build more focused and purpose-specific components on top. To be the foundation to build something
  richer on top.

  If you build something worth sharing with it, let me know and I'll add it to this section.
